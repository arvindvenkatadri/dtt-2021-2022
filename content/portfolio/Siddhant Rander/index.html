<h4>USUAL ITEMS BANNED</h4>
<p>In this data, I have used this data to find out how many schools have banned the things that seem very usual to us and astonished to see it being banned.</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/plot-1-1.png" width="480" /></p>
<p>In this graph, out of the 1071 unique items, I filtered out some items, and plotted it on the graph to see out of 480 schools, how many have banned it.
I used the filter command to filter, then used the aesthetics of assigning the <em>X Axis to items</em> and <em>fill by type of item banned</em> to give a better idea of the type.</p>
<p>It was very interesting to see how backless and crop tops were banned in so many schools, and even something as normal as sleeveless.</p>

<h2>My Course Reflection</h2>
<p>This course was about using R to plot graphs, maps and networks.</p>
<p>I learnt about the importance of numbers and the magic data visualisation can do to a human as it makes the data so much easier to read. The things we learnt in 5th Std about plotting graphs and how relevant it is in today’s world based on data. I learnt the right ways it could be used and learning to plot networks will be one of the major takeaways from this course as network science can change the way I look at communities, and how small the world could become due to networks.</p>
<p>It will help me be a better designer and one of the use cases I can think of is that as a UX UI designer when I conduct surveys to form personas, the data could be visualised and worked better using R.</p>
<p>Thank you Arvind for this workshop!</p>
