## Introduction

Hi I am Ashwath pursuing foudation studies at Srishti Manipal, and this page has the outcomes of my workshop on R

## Graph 1
### Description
Family - The ID of the family.
Father - The height of the father(inches).
Mother - The height of the mother(inches).
Sex - The gender of the child.
Height - The height of the child.
nkids - The number of adult children in the family.


```{r}
names(Galton)
glimpse(Galton)
```


I am going to plot on a question - Does the daughter's and son's height depend on mother's height? I am going to have my x value as 'mother' and y as 'height'.

## Question - Does the doughter's and son's height depend on mother's height?

```{r plot-1}
Galton <- Galton %>% drop_na()
ggplot(Galton, aes(x=mother, y=height, colour=sex)) + geom_point()
```

The graph shows us whether the children's height is dependent on their mothers. I used geom_point to plot my graph.


## Graph 2 & 3
### Description
In this we were asked to take any data set of our favorite show/ movie/ novel. I chose my favorite show - Sherlock Holmes. In this we were asked to create our own data set and work using that.

```{r}
sh_nodes <- read_delim("./sh_nodes.csv", delim=";")
sh_edges <- read_delim("./sh_edges.csv", delim=";")
sh_nodes
sh_edges
```

```{r}
sh <- tbl_graph(nodes = sh_nodes,
                edges = sh_edges,
                directed = FALSE)
```


I wanted to facet the information according to the relationship they share with each other and the type of bond also that they share with each other.


## faceting according to the type of bond they shared with eachother and the bonding they share between eachother

```{r}
set_graph_style()

ggraph(sh, layout = "linear", circular = TRUE) + geom_edge_link(aes(color = Type)) + geom_node_point() + facet_edges(~Type)

ggraph(sh, layout = "linear", circular = TRUE) + geom_edge_link(aes(color = Weight)) + geom_node_point() + facet_edges(~Weight)
```


I have used faceting. In this I chose to have one kind of layout, but with two different information. Their are two kind of graphs.
