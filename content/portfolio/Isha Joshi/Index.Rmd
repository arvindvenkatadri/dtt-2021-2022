## Introduction

This workshop taught me something that I would never opt to do on my own. Learning R gave me a new tool to imagine and create new designs. Analyzing and reading data can give so many creative outcomes.  

## Graph 1

**This data is about the adoption of Dogs in the US.  The different criteria on which the dogs are adopted is described in this data. The different varieties of breeds and color makes this data interesting.**

```{r read-1 , echo=FALSE}
allDogDescriptions <- read_csv("./alldogsdescriptions.csv")
Dogs <- allDogDescriptions %>% select(breed_primary,color_primary,age,sex,size,contact_state) 
Dogs
glimpse(Dogs)
```

**This graph describes the top 10 breeds which are adopted.**

```{r plot-1 , echo=FALSE}
Dogs %>% group_by(breed_primary) %>%
  count(name = "number") %>%
  arrange (desc(number)) %>%
  filter(number > 1800) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(
    x = reorder(breed_primary, number),
    y = number,
    fill = breed_primary
  )) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Graph of the top breeds of dogs at the centres by number") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "RdYlBu")

```

**In this graph the tools like reorder, arrange, group by and filter are used.  Trying out the function of scale filler brewer and selecting an appropriate color palette makes this graph more interesting and easy to read too.**

## Graph 2

**This data set is based on the TV show 'Friends' , the information collected is based on the conversation and interaction between each person in the chosen episodes.**

```{r read-2 , echo=FALSE}
friends_nodes <- read_delim("./Friends_nodes .csv" , delim = ",")
friends_edges <- read_delim("./Friends_edges .csv" , delim = ",")
friends_nodes
friends_edges

fn <- tbl_graph(nodes = friends_nodes, 
                edges = friends_edges, 
                directed = FALSE)
fn
```

**Network map.  This is a linear network of communication that shows the frequency of the conversations between each other and the kind of relationships they have among themselves.  The thickness of the lines depicts the strength of their relationship.  The thicker the line, frequent the communication.  Hence, stronger bond.**

```{r plot-2 , echo=FALSE}
ggraph(fn, layout = "linear", circular = FALSE) + 
  geom_edge_arc(aes(width = Weight , color = Type ), alpha = 0.8) + 
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.5, 3)) +
  geom_node_point(size = 4,colour = "maroon3") + 
  geom_node_text(aes(label = Name),repel = TRUE, size = 3,
                 max.overlaps = 10) +
  labs(edge_width = "Weight") +
  theme_graph()+
  theme(legend.position = "right", 
        aspect.ratio = 1)

```

## Graph 3

**The data set includes the conversations and communications between the characters of the TV show 'Friends'.**

```{r read-3 , echo=FALSE}
fn %>%activate(nodes) %>% 
  

mutate(degree = centrality_degree(mode = c("in"))) %>% filter(degree > 0) %>% 
  
activate(edges) %>% mutate(betweenness = centrality_edge_betweenness())
```

**The number of conversations each character has with another affects the intensity of the dots and the lines.  The bigger the points, the greater the connections. This explains the degree of the data.  The difference in the thickness of lines shows how many times a conversation has passed through another conversation between a third party.**

```{r plot-3 , echo=FALSE}
set_graph_style()
fn %>% 
activate(nodes) %>% 
  
mutate(degree = centrality_degree()) %>% activate(edges) %>%mutate(betweenness = centrality_edge_betweenness()) %>%
  
   ggraph(layout = "randomly") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(alpha = betweenness)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = degree, colour = degree)) + 
  scale_color_gradient(guide = "legend")


ggraph(fn,layout = "randomly") +
geom_edge_link(aes(alpha = centrality_edge_betweenness())) +
geom_node_point(aes(colour = centrality_degree(), 
                      size = centrality_degree())) + 
scale_color_gradient(guide = "legend",
                       low = "red",
                       high = "yellow")

```

## My Course Reflection

This course was all about collecting data , analyzing the data and learning how to represent in a creative visualization.  This class gave me a new direction to present my thoughts.  As this class was taught by the best Arvind , I enjoyed these two weeks of learning R too much.  I am sure R will help me in my later years.
