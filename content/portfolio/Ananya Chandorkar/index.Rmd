## Introduction
My name is Ananya Chandorkar, I am a 1st year Foundation student who will be pursuing Human Centered Design. I was honored to be in this workshop - Digital Thinking Tools. In this I was introduced to R which initially I found it very difficult but towards the end I saw myself enjoying it and understanding it.

I have chosen 3 dataset. One is the Galton dataset which I worked on earlier. The information is about the family and family members, height, sex. Second data set is about the migration of birds that I worked on this showed what all places/ the route the bird followed. The last dataset is about my favorite tv show - Sherlock Holmes and the connections between him and people around him.


## Graph 1
### Description
Family - The ID of the family.
Father - The height of the father(inches).
Mother - The height of the mother(inches).
Sex - The gender of the child.
Height - The height of the child.
nkids - The number of adult children in the family.


```{r}
names(Galton)
glimpse(Galton)
```
## Description on what I am going to do in my graph
I am going to plot on a question - Does the daughter's and son's height depend on mother's height? I am going to have my x value as 'mother' and y as 'height'.

## Question - Does the doughter's and son's height depend on mother's height?

```{r plot-1}
Galton <- Galton %>% drop_na()
ggplot(Galton, aes(x=mother, y=height, colour=sex)) + geom_point()
```


The graph shows us whether the children's height is dependent on their mothers. I used geom_point to plot my graph.



## Graph 2
### Description
In this I chose my data as 'Lifetrack oilbirds of Costa Rica', this was because I saw that there was data in this which I could use and was easy for me to work with. 

This is the link:

Screenshot of the map:

```{r}
birds_lines <- st_read("Data/lines.shp") 
birds_points <- st_read("Data/points.shp") 
```
## Description on what I am going to do in my graph
In this graph I am going to plot the coordinates of its migration pattern.



```{r}
data("World")
migration_countries <-  World %>% filter(name %in% c("Costa Rica", "Switzerland"))
```

```{r}
tm_shape(migration_countries) + tm_polygons() + tm_shape(birds_lines) + tm_lines(col = "red") + tm_shape(birds_points) + tm_bubbles(col = "yellow", size = 0.5)
```
## Brief concluding remarks. What does the graph show? What geometric aesthetics did you use, for example?
In this I have used the co-ordinates - Costa Rica and Switzerland. I used the tmap code to come up with this graph.


## Graph 3
### Description
In this we were asked to take any data set of our favorite show/ movie/ novel. I chose my favorite show - Sherlock Holmes. In this we were asked to create our own data set and work using that.


```{r}
sh_nodes <- read_delim("./sh_nodes.csv", delim=";")
sh_edges <- read_delim("./sh_edges.csv", delim=";")
sh_nodes
sh_edges
```

```{r}
sh <- tbl_graph(nodes = sh_nodes,
                edges = sh_edges,
                directed = FALSE)
```

## Description on what I am going to do in my graph
I wanted to facet the information according to the relationship they share with each other and the type of bond also that they share with each other.


## faceting according to the type of bond they shared with eachother and the bonding they share between eachother
```{r}
set_graph_style()

ggraph(sh, layout = "linear", circular = TRUE) + geom_edge_link(aes(color = Type)) + geom_node_point() + facet_edges(~Type)

ggraph(sh, layout = "linear", circular = TRUE) + geom_edge_link(aes(color = Weight)) + geom_node_point() + facet_edges(~Weight)
```
## Brief concluding remarks. What does the graph show? What geometric aesthetics did you use, for example?
I have used faceting. In this I chose to have one kind of layout, but with two different information. Their are two kind of graphs. 


## My Course Reflection
Initially it was really difficult for me to understand the codes and catch up with the class. I was also scared to approach people as I thought that I was not good enough as they were, in this I forgot the main aim of the workshop is to help me as an individual person. Eventually I got the hang of the graph. I did not participate much as I was still overcoming my barrier. I also felt that I was slow and could not finish all the work, I have to work on my speed.
Towards the end I had gained full confidence. For the Task 7 which was on Networks. In this we had to choose a show/ movie/ novel of our choice. I paired up with Ashwath. We both could not find a common show but later we decided to work with - BBC Sherlock Holmes show, the famous detective show. While working (not to be rude) my teammate did not contribute at all. I made the data set in Excel and imported it in Rmd file. After this I saw that the file was not being read as an error was showing. So later I saw how the other file which we learnt our code on (Grey's Anatomy) was done and filled my excel sheet accordingly. I also made a list of what were nodes and edges in the data set I had come up with to be sure. Later I started making the graphs after importing it. I made 4 graphs in total. One was the 'autograph' map which I made to cross check my data, if it shows any error, I was planning to remove it but it looked really nice and was part of my exploration and therefore left it. Later I wanted to show the bonding between Sherlock Holmes and other members of the family/ characters in the show with each other. For this I used ggraph, circular graph to represent the data. Later I wanted to use faceting, so I faceted according to the type of bond they shared with each other and the bonding they share between each other. I did this for weight and type which gave me different graphs. 
In the end we were asked to compile our work. In which I chose my 3 graphs and compiled those. Towards the end I felt very proud of myself for doing the work all by myself, I gained the confidence. At the same time I was sad that my team mate did not put in an effort to work. He did not show any interest, when I requested him to help me with the graphs he said that he knows nothing and that I complete the graph and send him all the files with the Rmd file. I just wished he had participated abit.
