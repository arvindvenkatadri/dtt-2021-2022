## Introduction

Hi I am Hemant pursuing foudation studies at Srishti Manipal, and this page has the outcomes of my workshop on R.

## Graph 1 & 2
### Description
I decided to work on creating a Breaking Bad dataset for this project. The show contains good amount of characters to play around with.
The show belongs to a unique genre, where they deal with the narcotics industry in the Southern USA. 

It took us some time to decide the headings of the columns in the nodes and edges dataset because it is not every other show. Since death played a big role in the show, we tried including the kill count of each character and also their involvement in drugs.


```{r}
nodes <-  read_delim("./Breaking Bad Character dataset.csv", delim = ",")
edges <-  read_delim("./Breaking Bad Relations.csv", delim = ",")

unique(nodes$Character_Name)
unique(edges$From)
unique(edges$To)
cbind(unique(edges$From), unique(edges$To)) %>% unique()

bb_graph<- tbl_graph(nodes = nodes,
                               edges = edges,
                               directed = FALSE)
bb_graph
```


A simple representation of the network of the Breaking Bad character. The nodes in the centre must represent the character of Jesse Pinkman and Walter White.

```{r}

ggraph(graph = bb_graph, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link0(width = 1, color = "red") +
  geom_node_point(shape = 18, size = 5, fill = "yellow", color = "blue", stroke = 2) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = Character_Name),repel = TRUE, size = 3,
                 max.overlaps = 10) +
  
  labs(title = "Breaking Bad Character Relationships")
```

```{r}
set_graph_style()

bb_graph %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  
  
mutate(degree = centrality_degree()) %>% 
 activate(edges) %>% 
 mutate(betweenness = centrality_edge_betweenness()) %>%
ggraph(layout = "kk") +
geom_edge_link(aes(alpha = betweenness)) +
geom_node_point(aes(size = degree, colour = degree)) +  scale_color_gradient(guide = "legend")
```

## Graph 3
### Description
Banned items dataset is a collection of items banned in US schools and consits of *schoolName*, *state*, *item*, *type* and *prohibited* column that specifies the gender.

```{r read-2}
my_data_2 <- read_csv("banned_items.csv")
glimpse(my_data_2)
```

I want to plot a graph to compare two item type based on their frequency in the banned item list. The two items are **pajamas** and **weapons**

```{r plot-2}
my_data_2 %>% group_by(state,item) %>% 
                filter(item=="weapons" | item=="pajamas") %>% count() %>% 
  ggplot(data = ., aes(fill=item))+ geom_col(aes(x=state, y=n))+ coord_flip()

```
