```{r setup, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = "", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
## Load frequently used packages for blog posts
library(tidyverse)
```

## Instructions

Delete all of this and paste in your own content right here!!

### Portfolio File Format

To create a new Portfolio entry, make sure that you selected `R Markdown (.Rmd)` as the _format_ option of the post when using the `New Post` `blogdown` addin.

### Setup chunk

Make sure you edit the setup chunk above and bring in **all** packages you need using *r library(package_name)*. 


### Inserting a Custom image in your Post

The easiest option is to use the `blogdown` _Insert Image_ RStudio addin to add an external image.

Another way: use a code chunk, if you already have the image downloaded and ready. Place the image in the **same folder** as this Post, and link to it with the chunk below:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align = "centre"}
knitr::include_graphics('./default.jpg')
```

### Narrative Text and Futher Code chunks

Start typing/pasting text here.

Diamonds are forever. We can see that from this graph below:

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + 
   geom_point(alpha = 0.1)
   
```
