## Introduction

Hi! I'm Prisha, and today I'll be showing you a glimpse into what I've learnt in this workshop as we fell down the rabbit hole of R-studio.

## Graph 1

This is a dataset talking about the different features of a group of diamonds.

```{r read-1}
glimpse(diamonds)
```

I randomly selected a group of point from the aforementioned dataset, and used it to plot a graph to understand the trends in the cut, carat and prices of diamonds:

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  slice_sample(prop = 0.2) %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x = carat, y = price, colour = cut)) +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
               scale_colour_viridis_d(option = "magma") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "How does the carat and cut affect the price?",
       subtitle = "corelation graph")
```
The price was higher with larger carats. There is an uoward trend with the cuts too.

## Graph 2

In this section, we learnt how to fetch coordinates and data about specific places, and use it to create a map. I created the map of New Delhi, and marked where the roads, buildings, schools and restaurants were. 

```{r}
bbox_delhi <- prettymapr::searchbbox("New Delhi, Delhi, India")
bbox_delhi
```

```{r}

dat_delhi_B <- extract_osm_objects (bbox_delhi, key = "building") 
dat_delhi_H <- extract_osm_objects (bbox_delhi, key = "highway")
dat_delhi_R <- extract_osm_objects(bbox_delhi, 
                             key = "amenity", 
                             value = "restaurant", 
                             return_type = "point") #<<
dat_delhi_S <- extract_osm_objects(bbox_delhi, 
                             key = "amenity", 
                             value = "school",
                             return_type = "point") #<<

```

```{r}
tm_shape(dat_delhi_B) +
  tm_fill(col = "darkgreen") +
  
  tm_shape(dat_delhi_H) +
  tm_lines(col = "blueviolet") +
  
  tm_shape(dat_delhi_R) +
  tm_dots(size = 1, col = "seagreen2", shape=  10) +
  
  tm_shape(dat_delhi_S) +
  tm_dots(size = 1, col = "pink", shape=  10) +
  
  tm_compass(type = "rose", position= c("right", "top")) +
  tm_scale_bar(width = 4, position = c("left", "bottom"), text.size = 1) +
  tm_layout(title = "New Delhi", title.size = 3, frame = TRUE, frame.lwd = 5, bg.color = "lightyellow") +
  tm_add_legend(type = "symbol", col = "pink",
                title="Schools")+
  tmap_style("watercolor")
```
guide:
Pink- school
Green- restaurants
Dark Green- buildings
Purple- roads


## Graph 3
For my last graph I wanted to show you an interactive network I made using the characters and their relationship with each other in the show Family Guy.

```{r}
familyguy_nodes <- read_delim(delim = ",", "./Data/familyguy-nodes.csv" )
familyguy_edges <- read_delim(delim = ",", "./Data/familyguy-edges.csv")
familyguy_nodes
familyguy_edges
```

```{r}
fg <- tbl_graph(nodes = familyguy_nodes, 
                edges = familyguy_edges, 
                directed = FALSE)
fg
```

```{r}
library(visNetwork)
familyguy_nodes
familyguy_edges

familyguy_nodes_vis <- familyguy_nodes %>% 
  rowid_to_column(var = "id") %>% 
  rename("label" = Names) %>% 
  mutate(sex = case_when(Sex == "F" ~ "Female",
                         Sex == "M" ~ "Male",
                         Sex == "N/A" ~ "Not Applicable")) %>% 
  replace_na(., list(Sex = "Transgender?")) %>% 
  dplyr::rename("group" = Sex)
familyguy_nodes_vis
familyguy_edges_vis <- familyguy_edges %>% 
  select(From, To) %>% 
  left_join(., familyguy_nodes_vis, by = c("From" = "label")) %>% 
  left_join(., familyguy_nodes_vis, by = c("To" = "label")) %>%
  select("From"= id.x, "To" = id.y) %>% 
  rename("to" = To, "from"= From)

familyguy_edges_vis
```


```{r}
familyguy_nodes_vis %>%

  visNetwork(nodes = ., edges = familyguy_edges_vis) %>% 
  visNodes(font = list(size = 40)) %>% 
  
  
  visGroups(groupname = "F", shape = "icon", 
            icon = list(code = "f182", size = 75, color = "tomato"),
            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>% 
  
  visGroups(groupname = "M", shape = "icon", 
            icon = list(code = "f183", size = 75, color = "slateblue"), 
            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>% 
  
  visGroups(groupname = "N/A", shape = "icon", 
            icon = list(code = "f22c", size = 75, color = "fuchsia"), 
            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>% 
  

  addFontAwesome() %>% 
  
 
  visInteraction(navigationButtons = TRUE,
                 hover = TRUE,
                 selectConnectedEdges = TRUE,
                 hoverConnectedEdges = TRUE,
                 zoomView = TRUE) 

```

## My Course Reflection
This workshop was something completely new for me. Coding isn't my forte, but this class was really enjoyable for me- especially with the patience with which Arvind would teach us a code over and over again.
I learnt how numbers and graphs can be translated to patterns and trends that can tell us so much more about it, and it also taught me the importance of design in tables and graphs.
This is going to make me look at how I can include analysis, patterns and data into my work from an all new, digital perspective. It can also help me present my work, and include interactive code in it in a new way!

I really enjoyed this class, and I hope I can explore this further.
